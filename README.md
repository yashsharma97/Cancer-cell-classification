# Cancer-cell-classification
We are going to classify a tumor as malignant(harmful or cancer causing) or benign(harmless) using the scikit learn and pandas machine learning libraries to create our prediction model using logistic regression and the data set we are going to use is the 'Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset' which comes pre-loaded with the scikit learn library.
